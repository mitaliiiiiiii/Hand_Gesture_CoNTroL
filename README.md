# Hand_Gesture_CoNTroL
This is my Eight Prroject.
Features:


Hand gestures mapped to PC actions (Launch apps, Show desktop, Lock screen)

Modern GUI with Dark Mode

Works with ML model or Random Simulation
⚠️ Camera access without OpenCV on Windows is painful.
This is why almost every real app uses cv2.
